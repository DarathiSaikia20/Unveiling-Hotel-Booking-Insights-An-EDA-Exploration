3. Pandas library
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************

## ðŸ“–	Steps Involved

  - **Data Cleaning** :
        Addressing missing values by dropping columns with a high number of missing values and handling other columns with relatively lower missing values
        using median and mode for numeric and text columns, respectively.

 - **Data Type Conversion and Feature Engineering** :
        Convert the data type of the "children" column from float to int64 for better data representation.
        Introduce new columns for further analysis, including 'arrival_date', 'total_stays', 'revenue', 'reserved_room_assigned', 'total_person', and 'customer_category'.

  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** :
        After preparing the data for analysis, conduct visualizations to understand the relationships between variables and uncover valuable insights for positive business impact.


    - **Key Insights from EDA** :

      - Months of July and August exhibit the highest booking activity.
      - Travel agencies (TA) show a high range of bookings.
      - City hotel is the preferred choice for customers, despite experiencing high cancellation rates.
      - Room type significantly impacts revenue for each hotel category.
      - Couples are the primary demographic trending towards hotel bookings.
      - Resort hotels are preferred over city hotels for longer stays.
      - Bed & Breakfast (BB) is the most preferred meal type by customers.
      - Parking allocation is not a primary factor, showing low requirements.
      - Customers from Portugal are trending towards hotel bookings.

These steps encompass the process of preparing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful insights from the dataset, providing valuable information for business growth and decision-making.
